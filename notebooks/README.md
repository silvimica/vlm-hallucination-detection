## Repository Structure
  
- **`train_models.py`**: A Python script to train models on the dataset. You can run the training process by executing the following command:
  ```bash
  python train_models.py
  ```
- **`model_performance.ipynb`**: Demonstrates the results and evaluation metrics obtained from the trained models. This notebook uses the saved weights generated during training to evaluate the model on the primary dataset.

- **`data_exploration.ipynb`**: Contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of textual features in the dataset. This notebook provides insights into the structure, distribution, and characteristics of the data used for training.

- **`model_performance_on_chatgpt_dataset.ipynb`**: Similar to the above, this notebook evaluates model performance on a ChatGPT-generat dataset.
